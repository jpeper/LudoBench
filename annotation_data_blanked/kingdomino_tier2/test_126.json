  "Question": "How many points does this kingdom score? Note: we are playing with the harmony variant.",

  "Rationale": "(7 fields X 2 crowns) + (1 wasteland X 2 crowns) + (1 wasteland X 1 crown) + (2 meadows X 3 crowns) + (2 mines X 4 crowns) + no bonus point for the harmony variant since this is not a perfect 5X5 square",
