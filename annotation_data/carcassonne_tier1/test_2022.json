  "Question": "Assuming that the goal is to create a rectangular shape with no gaps, how many additional tiles are needed to be placed to achieve this?",
  "Answer": "5",
  "Rationale": "Currently, the landscape has 7 tiles spread across 4 columns and 3 rows. To create a minimum shape with no gaps, we need to have a total of 12 tiles (4 columns x 3 rows). Therefore, we need to add 5 more tiles to fill in the gaps and achieve a rectangular shape.",
