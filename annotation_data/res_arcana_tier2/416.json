  "Answer": "6 Life, 1 Elan, 1 Gold",
  "Rationale": "The Fire Dragon doesn't affect the player itself. The first power of the Sacred Grove makes the player lose 1 water to gain 5 life. The second power can't be activated as it doesn't meet the criteria. No essences are gained from the other two cards.",
