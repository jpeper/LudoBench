  "Test Description": "Testing turn order perception. This is flipping the orientation to make sure we're not biased by left-to-right positioning.",
  "Difficulty Notes": "Testing the ability to distinguish turn order for a game round. Note, there are a set of horizontal tests where you need to resolve the ambiguity using intuition about the relative strength of the tiles (this requires some intuition that could be gleaned from the rules). This one in particular doesn't have any crowns pictured.",
  "Question": "Which player will place first in the next round?",
  "Answer": "Green",
