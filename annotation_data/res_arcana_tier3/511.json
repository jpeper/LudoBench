  "Question": "What is the maximum guaranteed number of victory points the player could have after 3 more actions, and what is the maximum number of essences they could have in their pool after these actions. Assume all other players have passed. Output the answer as: Previous VP amount: <num>, New VP amount: <num>, Previous essence count <num>, New essence count <num>",
  "Answer": "Previous VP amount: 5, New VP amount: 10, Previous essence count: 14, New essence count: 1",
  "Rationale": "In the first action, any one of the face-up monument cards can be purchased with 4 gold which can increase the victory points by 2. For the next two actions, the Coral Castle card can be bought which can increase victory points by 3. This can be done by: 1. Using the top power of the Sacred Grove card to gain 5 life for the cost of 1 water, this leaves the player with 6 life+4 water+4elan. 2. Any one of the cards at hand can be discarded for 1 water and 1 elan to buy the Coral Castle card. This makes the total victory points at the end to be 5+2+3. And the remaining essence is 1 life.",
