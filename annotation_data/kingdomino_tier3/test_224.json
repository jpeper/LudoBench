  "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
  "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
  "Question": "What are the most optimal kingdom scores that each of the four possible dominos could add to the player's kingdom if placed? For each domino, output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
  "Answer": "[[Domino: A, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: B, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 6], [Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 8]]",
  "Rationale": "Before placing the domino, the total score of the kingdom would be 4 (1x1 + 1x1 + 2x1). Now on adding domino A or B, according to placement rules, there could be no more points added to the kingdom. When adding C, in any of the positions where placing of C is possible, it would increase the score of the kingdom to 6, and on adding D domino, (in any valid manner), the score of the kingdom would double and become 8.",
