  "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over sequential reasoning steps that only make sense when placed together. E.g. a 'leap of faith'",
  "Difficulty Notes": "This example has some interaction and requires multi-step planning. It does not test any particular rules.",
  "Question": "What next domino should the green player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act cooperatively and will take actions to best-support maximizing your score. We are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules.",
  "Answer": "Domino: F, Previous kingdom score: 12, New kingdom score: 44",
