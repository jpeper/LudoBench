  "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on a subset of the score optimization problems. This time, giving it a score and asking it to derive the solution",
  "Question": "Select two tiles from among the eight to combine together. One must contain a one-crown lake half. Subject to this, your goal is to optimize the scoring from the non-lake squares when combined. Follow normal scoring and connection rules. Output as 'Dominoes: [<tile 1 name>, <tile 2 name>], Non-lake score: <scalar>]",
