  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering that it is the red player's turn, which tile should the red player choose from the available tile options (A, B) so as to get the maximum score by the end of this game. Assume that the game would end after this turn. Return the answer in the following format: [Tile = <selected tile>, total_points_turn = <the points by the end of this turn for this player>, total_points_final = <maximum points the player can achieve at the end of this game>]",
  "Answer": "[Tile = A, total_points_turn = 9, total_points_final =  23]",
  "Rationale": "According to the landscape in the given image: there are two blue standing meeples on two different incomplete roads, two blue farmers in two different fields: both of them having 2 connected cities connected to them, One red standing meeple on an incomplete Road, one red farmer: in the field that is connected to three complete cities. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points. 3) Farmers are scored only after all the turns are completed. Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city that the farmer is a part of. If the red player chooses tile A, the best way to gain points using the style is to place the tile in the hollow part of the landscape adjacent to the one below the tile containing the blue farmer; then please the red maple on top of the monastery; this would result in the monastery feature to complete and therefore giving the red player nine points. Considering that the game ends here, There are two red meeples that we would have to account for: one red maple on an incomplete Road spanning across five tiles giving the red maple Five Points, and one red farmer that contains three completed cities, therefore giving the player what did running for you a total of nine points. Therefore the total points red player would gain is (9 + 5 + 9) = 23 points. If the red player chooses Tile B, The best way to get maximum points from the style would be to place the tile below the tile containing the red farmer; and then place the red meeple on top of the city component of the tile; this would result in the completion of the city feature (2 tiles) with the red maple on it giving that player Four Points. Considering that the game  ends here, the only remaining component that we would have to account for would be the red farmer. the red farmer is present on the field that contains four completed cities therefore giving the red player 12 points.  so the total number of points that the right player would get at the end of the game if he chooses tile B is 16 points.  Therefore, the best choice for the right player would be to choose tile A and get a total of 23 points.",
