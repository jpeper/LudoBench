  "Test Description": "Testing ability to optimize moves or scoring for a given game state and trying to have a grounded rule application",
  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering that it is the red player's turn, which tile should the red player choose from the available tile options (A, B, C) so as to get the maximum score by the end of this turn. return the answer in the following format: [Tile = <selected tile>, total_points = <the maximum points by the end of this turn>]",
  "Answer": "[tile = B, total_points = 9]",
  "Rationale": "The current game state has: One incomplete city with a blue meeple on it, And three farmers (red, yellow, black) present on the fields. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points. 3) Farmers are scored only after all the turns are completed. Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city that the farmer is a part of. Since the red player does not have any meeples standing,  the only way that the red player can score points by the end of this turn is to complete a feature and place a maple on top of that feature. The red player can place tile B (monastery tile) below the top most completed city; and then place a red meeple as a monk over the monastery. This would only result in the red player getting 9 points.Note: The red player could also choose to place tile C in the bottom left corner to complete the road, and place a meeple on the road. This would result in the red player getting only 5 points (as the road is spread across 5 tiles). So comparing these options the best option would be to choose tile B  and achieve 9 points. therefore the red player would choose tile B  to achieve the maximum number of points by the end of the turn.",
