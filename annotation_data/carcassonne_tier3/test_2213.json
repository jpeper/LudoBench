  "Question": "Considering that it is the yellow players turn, which tile should the yellow player choose from the available tile options (A, B, C) so as to get the maximum score by the end of this game. Assume that the game ends after this turn. Return the answer in the following format: [Tile = <selected tile>, total_points_after_turn = <the maximum points by the end of this turn>, total_points_end_of_game = <maximum points after calculating points at the end of the game>]",
  "Answer": "[Tile = B, total_points_after_turn = 9, total_points_end_of_game = 18]",
  "Rationale": "In the given image of the game State we can observe that the landscape contains one blue meeple  on an incomplete City and one yellow meeple on an incomplete monastery. For the yellow player to earn some points, the way is to try and complete the monastery feature. This can be done by placing either Tile B or Tile C on top of the tile containing the monastery with the yellow monk. If Tile B is placed, there are two cities that would be formed, and in the field area of this tile, yellow player can place a yellow meeple as a farmer (in the laying down position). After the placement of this meeple, during the scoring of this turn, we would have 3 completed features (1 is for the blue players city + 1 for city with no meeples + 1 for the completed monastery) that have to be accounted for. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points 3)Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city if the player has a farmer in that field this is done at the end of the game after the last turn. Here for the B tile yellow player would score: 9 points from completed monastery. Whereas if we choose to go with selecting Tile C, then by the rules we would not be able to place any meeple on the city (as already occupied by blue player) resulting in the player only having one complete component (monastery) thereby receiving 9 points only and one more completed city component having the blue player’s meeple. After the final turn, when the end of game points are calculated, the farmer points are scored: in Tile B: there are 3 completed cities connected to field with yellow farmer = (3 completed cities * 3 points) = 9 points more making the total of 18 points (9 from turn + 9 from farmer). In Tile C: there would be only 2 completed cities connected to the field containing the yellow farmer resulting in (2 completed cities * 3 points) = 6 points more, giving a total of (6 pts from farmers + 9 points from turn) = 15 points. Therefore better option is tile B.",
