  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering that it is the blue player's turn, which tile should the blue player choose from the available tile options (A, B, C) so as to get the maximum score by the end of this game. Assume that the game would end after this turn. Return the answer in the following format: [Tile = <selected tile>, total_points_turn = <the points by the end of this turn for blue player>, total_points_final = <maximum points blue player can achieve at the end of this game>]",
  "Answer": "[Tile = A, total_points_turn = 12, total_points_final = 12]",
  "Rationale": "The current game state has: One incomplete city with a blue meeple on it, And three farmers (red, yellow, black) present on the fields. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points. 3) Farmers are scored only after all the turns are completed. Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city that the farmer is a part of. The only way in which the blue player can earn some points is by completing the city having a blue knight (or meeple) on it. Placing title A adjacent to the city containing the Blue meeple, the blue player would complete the city (Note the blue player cannot place any meeple on the field as the field already is occupied by another player). Therefore while scoring happens at the end of the round, the blue player would have a completed City feature that spans across five tiles and also contain one Shield. by the scoring rules this would result in the blue player gaining (5tiles * 2points) + (1sheld * 2points) = 12 points. Note: the blue player also can place tile B (monastery tile) below the top most completed city; and then place a blue meeple as a monk over the monastery. But this would only result in the blue player getting nine points. The blue player could also choose to place tile C in the bottom left corner to complete the road, and place a meeple on the road. This would result in the blue player getting only 5 points. So comparing all the options the best option would be to choose tile A  and achieve 12 points. therefore the blue player would choose tile A  to achieve the maximum number of points by the end of the turn. Now for the end of game score, the player does not have any farmers or incomplete features that blue meeple is present on. Therefore gains no extra points. So total points after the game remains to be 12.",
