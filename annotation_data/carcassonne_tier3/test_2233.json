  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering the situation that the yellow player has two turns one after the other. which tiles should the yellow player choose from the available tile options (A, B, C) so as to get the maximum score by the end of the game. Assume that 1) The game ends after these two turns. Return the answer in the following format: [Tiles = <selected tile, selected tile>; total_points_turn = <the maximum points by the end of two turns>; total_points_final = <the maximum points by the end of game>]",
  "Answer": "[Tiles = B, C; total_points_turn = 14; total_points_final = 26]",
  "Rationale": "The current game state has: One incomplete city with a blue meeple on it, And three farmers (red, yellow, black) present on the fields. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points. 3) Farmers are scored only after all the turns are completed. Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city that the farmer is a part of. The maximum points the yellow player can gain by the end of the two turns is: Turn 1: The player can place Tile B (monastery tile) in the hollow square gap below the top left completed city; place a yellow meeple as a monk on top of the monastery; this would complete the monastery feature and the yellow player would earn 9 points. Turn 2: The player can place Tile C in the lower left corner of the landscape; place a yellow meeple on the road feature; since the road feature is completed, the yellow player has a meeple on it, the player would gain (5 tiles * 1 point) = 5 points in total for the completed road. Therefore by the end of 2 turns the yellow player can score a maximum of (9 points from turn 1 + 5 points from turn 2) = 14 points in total. Now since the game ends after this round, the farmer (yellow meeple) present would be scored. Now after the placement of the tiles, the field that yellow player has the farmer in contains 4 completed cities and one incomplete city, resulting in the yellow farmer getting a total of (4 completed cities * 3 points) = 12 more points. This results in the yellow player getting 14 (from turns) + 12 (from farmer) = 26 points.",
