  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering the situation that the red player has two turns one after the other. which tiles should the red player choose from the available tile options (A, B, C) so as to get the maximum score by the end of the game? Assume that the game ends after these 2 turns. return the answer in the following format: [Tiles = <selected tile, selected tile>; total_points_turn = <the maximum points by the end of two turns>, total_points_final = <the maximum points by the end of the game>]",
  "Answer": "[Tiles = B, A; total_points_turn = 9; total_points_final = 36]",
  "Rationale": "The current game state has: One incomplete city with a blue meeple on it, And three farmers (2 red, 1 yellow) present on the fields. According to the rules of the game: 1)Each of the monastery’s tiles (the 8 surrounding tiles and the one with the monastery itself) is worth 1 point 2) Each tile in the completed city is worth 2 points. Each coat of arms in the completed city is worth an extra 2 points. 3) Farmers are scored only after all the turns are completed. Each field is worth 3 points per adjacent completed city that the farmer is a part of. The maximum points the red player can gain by the end of the two turns is: Turn 1: The player can place Tile B (monastery tile) in the hollow square gap below the top left completed city; place a red meeple as a monk on top of the monastery; this would complete the monastery feature and the red player would earn 9 points. Turn 2: The player can place Tile A in order to complete the city containing the blue meeple. Therefore by the end of 2 turns the red player can score a maximum of (9 points from turn 1) = 9 points in total. Now after the turn is over, the game comes to an end. Now we notice that the red player has a farmer in the right most field that contains 5 completed, and another farmer in the central field. By the rules, the red player would gain: (5 completed city * 3 points) = 15 more points from the right field, (4 completed cities * 3 points) = 12 more points from the central field. Therefore the total points that a red player can gain at the end of the game is (9 from turn + 27 from 2 farmers) = 36 points.",
