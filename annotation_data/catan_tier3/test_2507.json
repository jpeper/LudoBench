  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering that it is the blue player's turn, and the player rolls the dice summing to 6, what is the maximum number of cities the blue player can have on the board by the end of this turn? Return the answer in the following format:  [cities before:<number of cities before the turn>, settlements after: <number of cities after the turn>]",
  "Answer": "[cities before:1, cities after:3]",
  "Rationale": "In the given game state, the blue player already has 1 city, and 1 settlement on the board. Also the resource pool of the blue player contains 4 grain, 1 lumber, 1 brick, 1 wool, and 3 ore resource cards. The blue player also has 2 development cards (1 card having knight, 1 year of plenty). In order to build a settlement we need: (1 of each grain, lumber, brick, wool). In order to build a city we need: (1 settlement + 2 grains + 3 ore). The blue player can gain the maximum number of settlements by the end of the round in this way: the player has rolled a 6, since the player has a blue city on the corner of tile containing 6, the player would gain 2 ore resource card. Then the player would play the development card year of plenty, and take 1 ore and 1 grain resources from the central resource pool. This would result in a total of: 5 grain, 1 lumber, 1 brick, 1 wool, 6 ore resources. Then the player would have sufficient resources (1 of each grain, lumber, brick, wool) to build 1 settlement (intersection of 6, 3, 4). As a result of this the player would be breaking the longest road of the red player and would get the longest road card gaining 2 victory points. The number of remaining resources: 4 grain, 0 lumber, 0 brick, 0 wool, 6 ore resources. Now seeing the board, we find that there are 2 settlements of blue player which can be turned into cities. Since the blue player has enough resources to make two settlements into cities, the player would gain 2 cities. Note there are other places where the settlements can be placed too. Therefore by the end of this turn the blue player can have a maximum of 3 cities.",
