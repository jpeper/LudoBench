  "Difficulty Notes": "Easy optimization problem with intuitive solution",
  "Question": "Considering that the red player has 2 consecutive turns, and the player rolls the dice summing to 10 the first time, what is the maximum number of points the red player can have on the board by the end of these 2 turns? Can the player declare victory? Assume that in the second turn the player rolls a 5. Return the answer in the following format: [Victory_points_before: <the victory points player has in current gamestate>, Victory_points_after: <the victory points player has after 2 turns>, victory: <true/false– if the player can declare victory or not>]",
  "Answer": "[Victory_points_before: 6, Victory_points_after: 11, victory: true]",
  "Rationale": "In the given game state, the red player already has 1 city, and 2 settlements on the board. Also the resource pool of the red player contains 4 grain, 1 lumber, 1 brick, 1 wool, and 4 ore resource cards. The red player also has 3 development cards (2 cards having victory points, 1 monopoly). The total number of points that red player has currently is: longest road: 2 points + 1 city = 2 points + 2 settlements = 2 points = 6 points). In order to build a settlement we need: (1 of each grain, lumber, brick, wool). The red player can gain the maximum number of settlements by the end of the round in this way: the player has rolled a 10, since the player has a red settlement on the corner of tile containing 10, the player would gain 1 wool resource card. Now since the player has access to the maritime trade, the player would trade 2 ores to get 2 brick resource, and trade 2 more ores to get 2 lumber resources. Then the player would play the development card monopoly, and take all the wool resources from the blue player. This would result in a total of: 4 grain, 3 lumber, 3 brick, 3 wool, 0 ore resources. Then the player would have sufficient resources (1 of each grain, lumber, brick, wool) to build 3 settlements. Now seeing the board, we find that there are 3 possible places where red player can have settlements placed: intersections of: (4, dessert, 3), (4, 3, 6), (3, dessert, 8). Note there are other places where the settlements can be placed too. Therefore by the end of this turn the red player can have a maximum of 3 more settlements, making a total of 5 settlements by the end of this turn. Therefore this adds 3 more to the victory points making it 9 points. Next turn the player rolls a 5, no resources are gained. But the player has 2 victory points (  chapel and market ) which the player can play and gain a total of 11 Victory points. Yes the player can get victory as the total number of points is more than 10.",
