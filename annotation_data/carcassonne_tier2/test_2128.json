  "Question": "Consider that the red player chooses to place tile C on the landscape at the position marked with a Z. After placing the tile, the red player chooses to place a meeple on the road as a highwayman. After these two steps in this turn, how many points will the red player gain at the end of this turn's scoring?",
  "Answer": "5",
  "Rationale": "According to the game rules, when a road is completed, the player with the highwayman on the road scores 1 point for the each of the tiles the road passes through. In this case, after placing the C tile at position Z and then placing the red highwayman on it, the road becomes completed (as it completes the road from monastry to three-road intersection) and it is now passing by 5 tiles (including the newly placed C tile). Therefore, the red player scores 1 point for each the road tile, resulting in a total of 5 points for the completed road at the end of this turn's scoring.",
