  "Question": "How many unique ways can tile B be placed on the landscape such that it completes at least one incomplete city?",
  "Answer": "3",
  "Rationale": "According to the placement rules: We have to place a tile such that it continues the landscape. Option B has road on two adj. sides of grass and two adjacent sides of city. In the given landscape, there are two places where the domino can be placed in order to complete at least one incomplete city. The first place is on the bottom right side of the landscape, where there is an incomplete city, that can be completed by placing the tile B in 2 different ways. The second place is on the empty square of the landscape, where there is only one way of placing the tile. Therefore, the total number of ways tile B can be placed in the current landscape such that it completes at least one incomplete city is 2 + 1 = 3 ways.",
