  "Question": "Considering it is the red players turn, the player chooses to place tile A on the landscape at the position marked with a X. After placing the tile, the red player chooses not to place any meeple on the tile. After these two steps in this turn, how many points will the red player gain at the end of this turn's scoring?",
  "Answer": "0",
  "Rationale": "After placing A tile at the position X, the city feature is completed. In the completed city, there are 2 knights (meeples) belonging to the blue player and 1 knight (meeple) belonging to the red player. According to the game rules, the player with the most knights in a completed feature scores 2 points for each of the tiles the city is spread across: therefore blue player scored the points for the city. Since there is no other feature completed with red meeple on the completed features, the red player will not score any points for this turn.",
