  "Question": "Considering it is the blue players turn, the player chooses to place tile C on the landscape at the position marked with an X. After placing the tile, the blue player chooses not to place any blue meeple on the tile. After these two steps in this turn, how many points will the blue player gain at the end of this turn's scoring?",
  "Answer": "0",
  "Rationale": "After placing C tile at the position X, no feature is completed. The tile put at X would increase the kingdom but does not complete the feature. Since there is no completed feature, the blue player will not score any points for this turn.",
