  "Question": "Consider that it is yellow players turn. The player chooses to place B tile on the landscape in the position marked with an X. After placing the tile, the yellow player chooses to place a meeple on the monastry as a monk. After these two steps in this turn, how many points will the yellow player gain at the end of this turn's scoring?",
  "Answer": "9",
  "Rationale": "According to the game rules, when a monastry is completed, the player with the monk scores 1 point for the monastry tile itself and 1 point for each surrounding tile. In this case, after placing the B tile at position X and then placing yellow monk on it, the monastry becomes completed as it is now surrounded by 8 tiles (including the newly placed B tile). Therefore, the yellow player scores 1 point for the monastry tile and 8 points for the surrounding tiles, resulting in a total of 9 points for the completed monastry at the end of this turn's scoring.",
