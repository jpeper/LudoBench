  "Question": "What is the total number of completed cities the landscape can have after placing each of the option tiles (A, B) in the position marked with an `X`? Give your answer as [A = <num of completed cities after placing Tile A>, B = <num of completed cities after placing Tile B>].",
  "Answer": "[A = 2, B = 3]",
  "Rationale": "Before any placement, there is one completed city. After placing Tile A in the position marked with an X (only one way): it will complete another city by connecting to the adjacent city on two sides into one completed city. Therefore, the total number of cities after placing Tile A will be 2. On the other hand, placing Tile B will complete 2 other cities (one from each side), so the total number of cities after placing Tile B will be 3.",
