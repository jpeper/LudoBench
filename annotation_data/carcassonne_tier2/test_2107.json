  "Question": "How many players have a score of more than 25 points according to the given scoreboard?",
  "Answer": "2",
  "Rationale": "According to the given scoreboard, the players with scores are: red (sleeping) at 0, green (standing) at 10, and blue (standing) at 40. According to the game rules, a sleeping meeple is worth 50 points more than the number where the meeple is placed. Therefore, the red player has a score of 0 + 50 = 50 points, the green player has a score of 10 points, and the blue player has a score of 40 points. Comparing these scores, both the red and blue players have scores greater than 25 points.",
