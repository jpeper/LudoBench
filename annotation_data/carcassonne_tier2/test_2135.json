  "Question": "Consider that it is the red players turn. The player chooses to place tile A on the landscape marked with position Y. After placing the tile, the red player chooses to place a red meeple on the road as a highwayman. After these two steps in this turn, how many points will the red player gain at the end of this turn's scoring?",
  "Answer": "3",
  "Rationale": "After placing A tile at the position Y, the road feature is completed. In the completed road, there is one highwayman (meeple) belonging to the red player. According to the game rules, the player with the most highwaymen in a completed feature scores 1 point for each of the tiles the road is spread across: therefore red player scored the points for the road: 3 tiles containing the completed road feature * 1 point for each tile = 3 points. Since there is no other feature completed with red meeple on the completed features, the red player will score a total of 3 points.",
