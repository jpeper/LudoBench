  "Question": "According to the given scoreboard, which player has the highest score at this point in the game?",

According to the game rules, sleeping meeple is 50 points more than the number where the meeple is placed. Therefore, the red player has a score of 0 + 50 = 50 points, the green player has a score of 6 + 50 = 56 points, and the blue player has a score of 40 points. Comparing these scores, the green player has the highest score at this point in the game.",
