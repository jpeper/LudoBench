  "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over sequential reasoning.'",
  "Difficulty Notes": "This example has some interaction and requires multi-step planning. It tests if the methods try to score *across* the castle without direct adjacency.",
  "Question": "What next domino should the green player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act adversarially and will seek to minimize your score first and foremost before optimizing theirs.",
  "Answer": "Domino: H, Previous kingdom score: 11, New kingdom score: 21",
  "Rationale": "The current domino A can be placed next to three water tiles to increase water territory from 3 with 3 crowns to 5 with 3 crowns resulting in additional score of 6 (5X3-3X3). Now, since Green is the first to choose the next domino so other players' strategy doesn't work Green's gameplay. Adding E/F will result in same additional score of 3 (3 forests X 1 crown), adding G won't result in additional score, adding H will result in additional score of 4 (4 forests X 1 crown). So maximum increase will be due to domino H, resulting in increase of 10(6+4) points.",
